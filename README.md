# PARP-game

Text adventure for PARP.

Welcome to ‘Overcast’! You are Vetero, the Weather Mage. 
The time has come for your final trial - you must travel 
through the Gardens of Bloom, full of dangers and puzzles. 

You have three wands: 
- the blue wand of rain, 
- the red wand of sunbeam, 
- the white wand of frost. 

Your friend, Brusto the magical bottomless chest, looks at you expectantly. For some reason, it says "true." every time you do something. Just ignore it.
- Type `help.` for instructions.
- Type `look.` to sense magical objects around you.
